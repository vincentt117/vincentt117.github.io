# Personal website of Vincent Teng
Hi, I'm Vincent, a software engineering student at the University of Toronto. I'm a highly motivated developer, constantly seeking new, challenging, and exciting opportunities to improve my abilities.

From Kubernetes pod autoscaling for the 2019 premier of Game of Thrones, to a HoloLens research app that visualizes cancer cells, I've had the chance to build some exciting and high-impact solutions for a wide array of senarios and clients.

If you'd like to join me for the next challenge or are just interested in the site, please feel free to look around or find me on social media.

Thanks for visiting my site!
